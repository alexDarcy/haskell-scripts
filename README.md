===============

To learn Haskell, I decided to convert my Bash/Perl script into Haskell using
Shelly.

## Installing
To install Haskell, I recommand the Haskell platform. [See the official site for
more information](https://www.haskell.org/platform/).  
To install Shelly, `cabal` is the easiest way. [For more details, see this
reference](https://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Cabal-Install).
